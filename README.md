The objective of this package is to serve as an easier way to write
functions or snippets that I commonly use.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `rpersonalutils` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Steven314/rpersonalutils")

# -- OR --

# intall.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Steven314/rpersonalutils")
```

There are no plans to release on CRAN as this is primarily for personal
use.
